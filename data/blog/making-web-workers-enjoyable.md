## Background

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, the pursuit of creating responsive applications is a shared objective among developers.
The aim is typically to achieve a seamless user experience by maintaining a minimum of 60 frames per second, a standard set by the highly responsive[^1] mobile apps that users have grown accustomed to.
However, this can often pose a significant challenge due to the single-threaded[^2] nature of JavaScript.

In the current era, with an abundance of frontend libraries at our disposal, itâ€™s increasingly easy to compromise on performance as these libraries consume substantial resources.
This implies that when JavaScript is tasked with heavy computations or data processing, it can result in an unresponsive or janky user interface (UI), leading to user dissatisfaction.
Therefore, it is crucial to manage resources effectively to ensure a smooth and responsive UI.

## Web Workers

Web Workers[^3] were first published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) on April 3, 2009.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) conceptualize web workers as scripts that operate continuously.
These scripts are designed to run without being disrupted by other scripts that react to user interactions such as clicks.
By ensuring these workers are not interrupted by user activities, web pages can maintain their responsiveness while concurrently executing extensive tasks in the background.
This approach allows for a smoother and more efficient user experience.

### How to create a Web Worker

To make use of a Web Worker you have to create a new Worker by calling the `Worker()` constructor and passing the URL of a script file that will be executed in the Worker thread.

```typescript
// Vanilla
const worker = new Worker('heavy-calculation-script.js')
```

Nowadays with the usage of web bundlers such as Webpack[^4] or Vite[^5] Web Workers require a relative module url.

```typescript
// Bundlers
const worker = new Worker(new URL('./heavy-calcluation-script.js', import.meta.url))
```

### How to communicate with a Web Worker

Once you have created your Web Worker you are now able to send and receive messages from it.
To send messages you make use of the `postMessage()` method and to listen for messages you can use `addEventListener()` or set a callback directly on the `onmessage` property.

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('heavy-calculation-script.js')

// Sending a message to the Web Worker
worker.postMessage('Hello from main thread!')

// Listening for messages from the Web Worker
worker.onmessage = ({ data }: MessageEvent) => {
  console.log(data) // Logs: Hello from worker!
}

// Using event listeners
worker.addEventListener('message', ({ data }: MessageEvent) => {
  console.log(data) // Logs: Hello from worker!
})
```

You can send anything that is serializable[^6] when using `postMessage()`. JavaScript uses the structured clone algorithm[^7] to perform copying complex objects.

```typescript
// heavy-calculation-script.js Web Worker

// Sending a message to the Main Thread
self.postMessage('Hello from worker!')

self.addEventListener('message', ({ data }: MessageEvent) => {
  console.log(data) // Logs: Hello from main thread!
})
```

In the context of a web worker `self`[^8] refers to an object that points to current Web Worker context. It is a reliable way to reference the worker context, unlike the `this` keyword, which can behave unpredictably in various situations.
Normally when using `this` in the global execution context[^9] will refer to the `Window`[^10] object.

### Drawbacks of Web Worker communication

Whilst the Web Worker API to send and receive gets the job done it is not very developer friendly because of its low-level API.
It requires a lot of manual management of message routing and payload marshaling[^11].
There are certain patterns that seem to work nicely with `postMessage()` such as the Flux[^12] pattern but there are better libraries out there that can make the use Web Workers a lot more enjoyable and intuitive.

## Comlink

Comlink[^13] is a tiny library developed by Google. Its primary function is to simplify the process of working with Web Workers by eliminating the complexities associated with using `postMessage()`.
It achieves this by adopting an RPC (Remote Procedure Call)[^14] style for message transmission and leveraging JavaScript Proxies[^15] that maintain a reference to the original target.
In essence, Comlink enables seamless access to any element from the Main Thread within a Web Worker and vice versa.
This bidirectional accessibility significantly enhances the developer experience.
Furthermore, when used in conjunction with TypeScript[^16] it supports autocomplete features, making coding even more efficient and enjoyable.

### How to use Comlink

Using Comlink is fairly straight forward as shown below:

```typescript
import { wrap } from 'comlink'

// Create Web Worker
const worker = new Worker('heavy-calculation-script.js')

// Wrap the Web Worker using the wrap method from Comlink
const wrappedWorker = wrap(worker)

// Call any exposed methods from your Web Worker
wrappedWorker.exposedMethod() // Logs: Hello from worker!
```

```typescript
// heavy-calculation-script.js Web Worker
import { expose } from 'comlink'

const api = {
  exposedMethod() {
    console.log('Hello from worker!')
  },
}

// Call expose from Comlink to expose anything you like to the Main Thread to have access to
expose(api)
```

## Conclusion

I hope this gives a better understanding on how Web Workers can help with offloading heavy computations, intensive tasks or long-running pieces of code.
This allows for the Main Thread to run as efficient and responsive as possible for not only a better user experience but also a great developer experience when using libraries such as Comlink.
